<p>
This is an individual assignment which involves modifying the
assignment 2 compiler for the language PL0
(provided on the course web page with this assignment) 
to add
record (struct) 
and
pointer types. 

</p><h1>Assignment Compiler files</h1>

All sources for the assignment PL0 compiler are available as a2.zip (below). 
Please be sure to use the version for this assignment and not the one used for the tutorials or another assignment. 
There are differences (like the lexical tokens you need for this assignment are only defined in this version).

follow the course discussion board (https://edstem.org/) for any
updates and further information on the assignment.
</p><ul>
  <li>Do not use imports for external packages other than those in <span class="emphasis">java.util.*</span>.
    Note that IntelliJ may offer the option of importing an external package to resolve an issue;
    please avoid taking this option because it will often add an erroneous import that you will not need.
    Such imports lead to the compilation failing in the environment in which your compiler will be assessed
    because that environment may not include the external libraries.
    Please check you are not importing external libraries before submitted.
<!--
  <li>Many people for assignment 1 imported arbitrary external libraries (that weren't actually used).
   Such imports led to the compilation failing in my test environment that does not include those libraries.
   Please check you aren't importing external libraries before submitted.
   <b>The only external imports allowed are from java.util.*</b>
-->
  </li><li>You must <b>only</b> modify the files that must be submitted (see below).
  </li><li>You must <b>not</b> modify any other files because we will be testing your implementation
    using the existing other files with your submitted files.
  </li><li>Please do <b>not</b> reformat the files because we would like to just print the differences
    between the originals and the versions you hand in.
  </li><li>Please keep the length of lines in your files below <b>100</b> characters, so that we can print them sensibly.
  </li><li>Please avoid using <b>non-standard</b> characters, e.g. Chinese characters, including in the comments.
    Non-standard characters are not accepted by some Java compilers and
    all comments should be readable by the person assessing your assignment.
  </li><li>Your implementation should be in Java <b>1.8</b>.
    Set the IntelliJ preferences for the Java compiler to 1.8 (or use the "-source 1.8" option to the Java compiler).
  </li><li>Please remove any debugging output before your assignment is submitted
    because debugging output will cause your program to fail our automated testing of your assignment.
  </li><li>Either avoid using tabs or set your tabs stops to 4 spaces (this is the default for IntelliJ)
    so that your files will print sensibly.
</li></ul>
Read the fine print in detail before you start!
And, most important, when you have finished implementing the assignment,
come back and reread the fine print again.


<h1>Overview</h1>

<h2>Records and pointers</h2>

Records are similar to C structs (and very simple Java classes).
They only have fields (no methods).
As well as records, we have a pointer type.
Unlike Java classes,
we distinguish between a record object and a pointer to that object.
<p>
Records are accessed via value (rather than reference),
i.e., assignment of records copies all fields rather than 
assigning a reference.
However, for a variable of type <i>pointer to a record</i>
we only assign the pointer.
</p><p>
Record and pointer types may be declared in a type definition,
for example, we can declare 
<b>List</b> as the type of a pointer to a value of type <b>Node</b>.
The type <b>Node</b> is a record that contains two fields: 
<b>x</b> of type integer,
and
<b>next</b> of type <b>List</b> (i.e., pointer to a <b>Node</b>).
</p><ul><b>
    type 
    <ul>
       Node = record x: int; next: List end;<br>
       List = ^ Node;
    </ul>
</b></ul>
<p>
For example, one may declare variables <b>r</b> and <b>r2</b> to be of a record type,
and <b>p</b> and <b>q</b> to be pointers as follows.
</p><ul><b>
    var r: Node; r2: Node; p : List; q: List;
</b></ul>
A pointer value may be assigned a dynamically allocated object of its base
type via a <b>new</b> expression.
<ul><b>
    p := new List
</b></ul>
Fields of a record <b>r</b> may be assigned appropriate values:
<ul><b>
    r.x := 2;   r.next := p
</b></ul>
and the values of the fields may be accessed:
<ul><b>
    write r.x
</b></ul>
Assignment of whole records is also allowed, e.g.,
<ul><b>
    r2 := r
</b></ul>
assigns both fields of <b>r2</b> the corresponding fields of <b>r</b>.
<p>
A record constructor allows a value of record type to be built, e.g.,
the following assignment to <b>r</b> is equivalent to the two assignments 
to the fields of <b>r</b> above.
</p><ul><b>
    r := Node{ 2, p }
</b></ul>
A record constructor consists of the type identifier of a record 
followed by a list of expressions in braces that are assigned to the
fields of the record. The order of the expressions corresponds to the 
order of declaration of the fields in the record type.
<p>
The value pointed to by a pointer is referenced by <b>p^</b> and
the fields of that object by <b>p^.x</b> and <b>p^.next</b>.
For example, we may set the <b>x</b> field of the object pointed to
by <b>p</b> to be <b>34</b> via the assignment
</p><ul><b>
  p^.x := 34
</b></ul>
and we may dynamically allocate a new record object and set
the <b>next</b> field of the record pointed to by <b>p</b> 
to point to that object by
<ul><b>
  p^.next := new List
</b></ul>
Note that a <b>new List</b> expression can be used anywhere an expression
of type <b>List</b> is expected.
Arbitrary chains of dereferencing are allowed.
For example, <b>p^.next^.next</b> references the <b>next</b> field of
the object pointed to by the <b>next</b> field of the object pointed
to by <b>p</b>.
Such references may be used
either on the left side of an assignment 
or on the right side within an expression where a value of
that type (<b>List</b> in the example) is expected.
For example, we may increment the field <b>x</b> of
the object <b>p^.next</b> by the statement:
<ul><b>
  p^.next^.x := p^.next^.x + 1
</b></ul>
Pointers may be directly assigned.
For example, after the assignment
<ul><b>
  q := p
</b></ul>
both <b>q</b> and <b>p</b> both point to the same object.
If we then perform the assignment
<ul><b>
  q^.next := nil
</b></ul>
where <b>nil</b> is the special pointer constant for a null pointer,
then because both <b>q</b> and <b>p</b> point to the same object,
the value of <b>p^.next</b> will also be <b>nil</b>.
Pointers may also be compared (but only for equality and inequality),
so after the above assignment the comparison
<ul><b>
  if p^.next = nil then ...
</b></ul>
will return true and the <b>if</b> statement will take the <b>then</b>
branch.


<h1>Syntax Changes</h1>

The reserved keywords "record" and "new" have already
been added to the lexical analyser as the tokens <i>KW_RECORD</i>
and <i>KW_NEW</i>,
and the symbols "{", "}", "." and "^" have been added as tokens 
<i>LCURLY</i>, <i>RCURLY</i>, <i>PERIOD</i> and <i>POINTER</i>.
They have also been added to the terminals definitions in PL0.cup.
<p>
The syntax for record and pointer type definitions follows.
It is given in EBNF, but you won't be able to use the EBNF directly 
in the parser generator <b>Java-CUP</b>.
</p><ul>
  Type &#8594; SubrangeType | TypeIdentifier | RecordType | PointerType<br>
  RecordType &#8594; "record" Fields "end"<br>
  Fields &#8594; Field { ";" Field }<br>
  Field &#8594; IDENTIFIER ":" TypeIdentifier<br>
  PointerType &#8594; "^" TypeIdentifier
</ul>
<p>
A reference to a field of a record can be used as an LValue
either within an expression or on the left side of an assignment.
A pointer dereference can also be used as an LValue.
A "new" expression or a record expression can be used as a Factor in an expression.
</p><ul>
  LValue &#8594; IDENTIFIER  |  LValue "." IDENTIFIER  |  LValue "^"<br>
  Factor &#8594; ... | "new" TypeIdentifier | TypeIdentifier "{" ExpList "}"<br>
  ExpList &#8594; Condition { "," Condition }
</ul>
Note that a field of a record may itself be of type record.
Hence the above syntax has an LValue before the "." 
rather than an IDENTIFIER
and similarly there is an LValue before "^".

<h2>The Parser Generator Java-CUP</h2>

The parser specification for the compiler is specified in the file
<span class="filename">PL0.cup</span>.
You will need to add productions (and their associated actions) to the
specification and then run the parser generator <span class="filename">Java-CUP</span>
(manually or automatically)
to generate the files <span class="filename">CUPParser.java</span> and <span class="filename">CUPToken.java</span>.
Do not modify these two Java files directly 
(even if you think you understand them (do you really?)) -
remake them from <span class="filename">PL0.cup</span>.
You should make the compiler before you change anything just to see
what forms of messages to expect. 
When you make the compiler (before you modify it) 
there will be some warning messages about the terminal symbols like
<span class="keyword">ILLEGAL</span>
being declared but never used;
these are to be expected at this stage.
Any new warning/error messages will be significant.
Beware that if there are Java-CUP errors reported,
the Java files for the parser will not be generated,
so check for Java-CUP errors first.
There is HTML documentation for <span class="filename">Java-CUP</span> available from the
class web page (with the assignment).


<h2>The Scanner Generator JFlex</h2>

All the lexical tokens for this version of the compiler have already been
added to the lexical analyser. 
<p>
The file <span class="filename">Lexer.java</span> is automatically generated by the scanner
generator <span class="filename">JFlex</span> from <span class="filename">PL0.flex</span>;
again, do not modify <span class="filename">Lexer.java</span>  -
remake <span class="filename">Lexer.java</span> from <span class="filename">PL0.flex</span>.
</p><p>
Both <span class="filename">Java-CUP</span> and <span class="filename">JFlex</span> are available with the
assignment files on the course web page,
with instructions on how to run them in IntelliJ.
Java archives for <span class="filename">Java-CUP</span> and <span class="filename">JFlex</span> are part of the
IntelliJ project for the assignment.

</p><h1>Static Semantic Restrictions</h1>

<h2>Records</h2>

The names of fields of a record must be distinct.
<p>
All of the type identifiers used for fields
must be defined type identifiers.
</p><p>
A field of a record may be of any type, 
including a pointer or record type but may not include the
same record type as being declared either directly or indirectly,
e.g. the following is invalid both
because R directly includes R and
because R indirectly includes R, via Q.
</p><pre>    type R = record x : int; p : Q; next: R end;
         Q = record y : int; q : R end;
</pre>
<p>
The rule for well formedness of a <b>record</b> type is given below.
</p><center>
  &#8704; i,j &#8712; 1..n &nbsp; • &nbsp; i &#8800; j  &#8658; id<sub>i</sub> &#8800; id<sub>j</sub>
  <br>
  &#8704; j &#8712; 1..n &nbsp; • &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
     syms&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  typeof(t<sub>j</sub>) = T<sub>j</sub> 
  <br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  typeof(record id<sub>1</sub>: t<sub>1</sub>; id<sub>2</sub>: t<sub>2</sub>; 
  ... id<sub>n</sub>: t<sub>n</sub> end) = 
    RecordType([ (id<sub>1</sub>,  T<sub>1</sub>), (id<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>), 
           ... (id<sub>n</sub>, T<sub>n</sub>) ])
</center>
<p>
A reference to a field of a record (e.g., <b>r.x</b>) consists of 
an <b>LValue</b>, (e.g., <b>r</b>),
which must be a record
and a field name, (e.g., <b>x</b>),
which must be one of the fields of that record.
Note that an <b>LValue</b> may appear on either the left or
right side of an assignment.
Hence the two uses of <i>ref</i> in the following rule.
</p><center>
  j &#8712; 1..n
  <br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
    e: ref(RecordType([ (id<sub>1</sub>,  T<sub>1</sub>), (id<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>), 
                 ... (id<sub>n</sub>, T<sub>n</sub>) ]))
  <br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      e.id<sub>j</sub>: ref(T<sub>j</sub>)
</center>
For example,
<center>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  
    r: ref(RecordType([ (x,  int), (b, boolean) ]))
  <br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      r.x : ref(int)
</center>
For a record constructor,
its type identifier must be a record type and it gives the type of the constructed record.
The expressions in the type constructor must match the fields of the record in the order
in which they were declared in the record type declaration.
Each expression must be assignment compatible with its corresponding field.
<center>
  <br>
  id &#8712; dom(syms)<br>
  syms(id) = TypeEntry(RecordType([ (id<sub>1</sub>,  T<sub>1</sub>), (id<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>), 
                 ... (id<sub>n</sub>, T<sub>n</sub>) ]))
  <br>
  &#8704; j &#8712; 1..n &nbsp; • &nbsp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
     syms&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  e<sub>j</sub> : T<sub>j</sub> 
  <br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;
      id{ e<sub>1</sub>, e<sub>2</sub>, ... e<sub>n</sub> } : RecordType([ (id<sub>1</sub>,  T<sub>1</sub>), (id<sub>2</sub>, T<sub>2</sub>), 
                 ... (id<sub>n</sub>, T<sub>n</sub>) ])
</center>
<p>
Assignments between records are allowed,
provided the left and right sides of the assignment are of the same type. 
Two types are considered equivalent if they are the same type identifier,
or if one is a type identifier, B, 
that is defined as equal to another type identifier, A, 
i.e.,
</p><ul><b>
    type
    <ul>A = record x: int; y: int end;<br>
        B = A;
    </ul>
</b></ul>
[This makes the implementation simpler than doing structural equivalence of records.]
<p>
Comparison of records is not supported.


</p><h2>Pointers</h2>

The identifier in the pointer type definition must be a type identifier.
It can be of any type (not necessarily a record type as in the example).
<p>
The rule for well formedness of a <b>pointer</b> type is given below.
</p><center>
  syms&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  typeof(t) = T 
  <br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  typeof(^t) = PointerType(T)
</center>
<p>
To be dereferenced (using "^") an LValue, <b>p</b>, must be of type
ref(PointerType(T)), for some type T.
The type of the result of the pointer dereference is ref(T).
</p><center>
  syms&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  e : ref(PointerType(T))
  <br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  e^ : ref(T)
</center>
The identifier in a <b>new</b> expression must be a pointer type.
Hence, for a type identifier id,
<center>
  id &#8712; dom(syms)
  <br>
  syms(id) = TypeEntry(PointerType(B))
  <br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp; (new id) : PointerType(B)
</center>
<p>
Assignment of pointer values and comparison of pointer values,
for equality and inequality only,
is allowed provided the types are equivalent.
If <b>T</b> is declared as a pointer type
(i.e., PointerType(B) for some type B) then
the equality and inequality operators have the following additional types.
</p><ul>
  = : T x T &#8594; boolean<br>
  &#8800; : T x T &#8594; boolean<br>
</ul>
An exception here is the special constant <b>nil</b> which is a
pointer value that is compatible with all pointer types.
The constant <b>nil</b> has already been defined.
It is of the special pointer type <i>NIL_TYPE</i>,
which is compatible with any pointer type.
Hence for any type identifier id,
<center>
  id &#8712; dom(syms)
  <br>
  syms(id) = TypeEntry(PointerType(B))
  <br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp; nil : PointerType(B)
</center>
<p>
Two pointer types are considered equivalent if their base types are equivalent.
e.g.,
</p><ul><b>
    type
    <ul>C = ^A;
        D = C;
        E = ^A;
    </ul>
</b></ul>
Types C, D and E are all compatible.

<p> 
Note that <i>Type.java</i> already includes record and pointer types.


</p><h1>Dynamic Semantics</h1>

<h2>Records</h2>

A record must be allocated enough space to contain values for all its fields,
either on the stack if it is a local variable,
or 
on the heap if it is dynamically allocated using <b>new</b>.
<p>
A field reference, <b>r.x</b>, acts like a variable of the type of the field
and hence can be used on either the left or right sides of assignments.
</p><p>
For the record assignment 
</p><ul><b>
  r := p^
</b></ul>
all the fields of r are assigned the corresponding fields of the
record pointed to by p.
<p>
Because we are copying values and not references, 
all the fields need to be assigned
(see the Object Code section for a way to do this simply).

</p><h2>Pointers</h2>

The dynamic semantics of the <b>new</b> expression and
of accessing a pointer are conventional.
<p>
If <b>p</b> is of type ref(PointerType(T)) then
a pointer dereference, <b>p^</b>, corresponds to the
object (of type ref(T)) pointed to by the pointer <b>p</b>.
If the value of the pointer <b>p</b> being dereferenced is <b>nil</b>
the dereference is invalid (a run time error).
</p><p>
The expression <b>new List</b> dynamically allocates space on the heap
for an object of the type pointed to by <b>List</b> and 
returns the address of that new object.
Objects dynamically allocated via a <b>new</b> have a life time that
is not restricted to that of the variable via which they were
allocated.
For example, an object may be created within a procedure using a local
variable within the procedure to perform the <b>new</b>.
Provided that variable's value (the pointer to the new object) is
assigned to a variable or field that is accessible via variables
global to the procedure, before the procedure exits,
the object will remain accessible.
</p><p>
Although we dynamically allocate objects via the <b>new</b> statement,
we won't implement garbage collection of objects that are no longer
accessible. 



</p><h1> Object Code</h1>

The PL0 compiler generates code for the Stack Machine.
A description of the stack machine is available in
<a href="https://learn.uq.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-6438721-dt-content-rid-35368994_1/courses/COMP4403S_7120_21405/publicweb/notes/Inst.pdf">Inst.pdf</a>.
See also the file <i>StackMachine.java</i> (near the end)
for details of the instruction set.

<h2>Records</h2>

To implement record assignments the stack machine includes the
<i>LOAD_MULTI</i> and <i>STORE_MULTI</i> instructions,
both of which take a count of the number of words to load from or store
to an address. 
<ul>
<li>the source address for loading (or target address for storing) is in second top of stack, and </li>
<li>the number of words to be loaded (or stored) is in the top of the stack.</li>
</ul>

<h2>Pointers</h2>

There is an instruction, <i>ALLOC_HEAP</i>,
which assumes that there is an integer on the top of the stack that
represents the size of the object it is to allocate (new).
It pops that value from the stack and replaces it with the absolute address of
a newly allocated object of that size.
The stack machine does not support disposing objects or garbage collection.
<p>
If there is insufficient space then <i>ALLOC_HEAP</i> will fail 
with a "memory overflow" message.
In the implementation of the stack machine there is a single array
representing the whole of memory:
the stack (the bottom end of the array) and
the heap of dynamically allocated objects (the top end).
If either pushing onto the stack reaches the lower limit of the heap,
or allocating on the heap reaches the top of the stack,
then there is insufficient memory and the program aborts
(with the same error message in both cases).
</p><p>
As the instructions <i>LOAD_FRAME</i> and <i>STORE_FRAME</i> expect
an address that is an offset from the frame pointer for the current (procedure) scope,
you will need to use the instruction <i>TO_LOCAL</i> which converts an
absolute address (the pointer value) into an address relative to the
current frame pointer.
</p><p>
The <i>STOP</i> instruction with a parameter of <i>StackMachine.NIL_POINTER</i>
indicates a nil pointer dereference error.

</p><h1>Tests</h1>

Some tests are available in the <b>test-pgm</b> directory (in a2.zip),
and can be used to help you to debug your code. All of the tests can
be run together using the <b>Test_LALR</b> configuration. You can also
individually run a test using <b>PL0_LALR</b> on a selected PL0
program. The test cases of the form
<b>test-base*.pl0</b> are useful for regression testing, to make sure
that you haven't broken any existing functionality in the compiler, and
the other tests can help you find bugs in the new compiler
features.

<h1>Student Misconduct</h1>

Students are reminded of the University's policy on student
misconduct, including plagiarism.  See the course profile and the
School web page
<a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/itee-student-misconduct-including-plagiarism">
http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/itee-student-misconduct-including-plagiarism</a>
<p>
You are expected to protect your files so that they are not readable by other users.
</p><p>
Your assignment is expected to be your own individual work and must
not include code copied from other students, current or past.  You are
also reminded not to post your (partial) solutions to assignments to
any place accessible by others (before or after the assignment
deadline), including the course discussion board or emailing to other
students.  If you need that sort of help consult the lecturer and/or
tutor.  Note that course discussion board allows private posts to the
instructors.
</p><p>
This assignment compiler is provided solely for the purposes of doing
this assignment and your solutions must never be shared, especially
publicly, even after completion of the course.  Such publication would
be considered both student misconduct and a breach of copyright.

</p><h1>Late Submission</h1>

<p>See section 5.3 of the course profile for details.</p>

<p>
If there are documented medical or exceptional circumstances that will
affect your ability to complete the assignment by the due date, then
you can apply for an extension. Extensions to non-exam assignments
must be requested via <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/">my.UQ</a>. You
can find instructions on how to submit your
request <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-extension">online</a>.
</p>

<p>
If the assignment is submitted after the deadline, without an approved
extension, a late penalty will apply. The late penalty shall be 10% of
the maximum possible mark for the assessment item will be deducted per
calendar day (or part thereof), up to a maximum of seven (7)
days. After seven days, no marks will be awarded for the item. A day
is considered to be a 24 hour block from the assessment item due
time. Negative marks will not be awarded.
</p>

<!--
A penalty of 5% of the maximum mark for an assignment will be deducted for each day or part thereof late up to a limit of 7 days,
after which time assignments will not be accepted for assessment unless you have been granted an extension.
<p>
As we plan to hand back assignments a week or two after submission,
requests for extension will not be accepted more than one week late,
unless there are exceptional circumstances. 
<p>
Requests for extensions should be accompanied by suitable documentation 
(see the course profile for details).
<p>
Personal hardware or computer failures are not grounds for extension.
Assignments must be backed up on the university system.
-->

<h1>Submission</h1>
<p>
Please keep the length of lines in your files below 100 characters,
so that we can print them sensibly.
You should avoid using tabs or set your tabs stops to 4 spaces so that
when we print them 
(with tab stops set to 4 spaces) 
they will print sensibly.
Don't forget to remove any code generating debugging output
and rogue external imports before submission.
</p><p>
You must submit your completed assignment electronically through 
the assessment section of 
the course <a href="https://learn.uq.edu.au/">BlackBoard site</a>
(the BlackBoard Assessment page rather than the course web pages).
</p><p>
You need to submit the following list of individual files, not a .zip file
(note that file names are case-sensitive) for evaluation and marking. 
</p><ul>
  <li>PL0.cup</li>
  <li>StaticChecker.java</li>
  <li>CodeGenerator.java</li>
  <li>ExpNode.java</li>
  <li>ExpTransform.java</li>
</ul>
You can submit your assignment multiple times,
but only the last copy submitted will be retained for marking.


<h1>Assessment</h1>
<p>
The assignment is marked out of a total of 20 marks.
<br>
Marks will be allocated as follows:
</p><ul>
   <li>6 Syntax analysis and tree building
   </li><li>9 Static semantics checking
   </li><li>5 Code generation
</li></ul>
Marks will be awarded for the correctness of the changes to each category.
Readability and modular structure will also be criteria.
For readability, we expect that you follow good software engineering practice,
such as appropriate choices of variable names,
consistent indentation, appropriate comments where needed, etc.
For modularity we expect you introduce new methods where it makes sense to help structure the program
and to avoid unnecessary duplication of code.
Use of generic Java utility interfaces (like Set, Map, List, Queue, ...) and
their implementations (like HashSet, ..., TreeMap, ..., LinkedList, ...)
is encouraged.
We expect you to produce well structured programs that are not unnecessarily complex,
both structurally
(e.g. complex control flow that is hard to follow),
and in terms of execution time and space requirements,
(e.g. an O(n) algorithm is preferred to an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm,
and a O(log n) algorithm is even better).

<p>
We will not be concerned with the quality of syntactic error recovery 
because the parser generator <i>CUP</i> takes care of that for the most part,
but you must handle semantic errors appropriately,
including handling the situation when there is a syntax error,
i.e., your compiler should not crash because of a syntax error.
</p><p>
Your assignment files will be compiled in the context of the remaining
assignment files and put through a sequence of tests.
The total mark for this assignment will be limited by the
overall success of the development in the following way:
</p><ul>
   <li>The program submitted does not compile: Maximum 10/20.</li>
   <li>The program submitted will not correctly handle any test case with 
       the new facilities: Maximum 13/20.</li>
</ul>
You are not required to correct any bugs that may exist in the original compiler.
However, we would appreciate being informed of any such bugs
that you detect, so that we can correct them,
or any improvements to the compiler you might like to suggest.
