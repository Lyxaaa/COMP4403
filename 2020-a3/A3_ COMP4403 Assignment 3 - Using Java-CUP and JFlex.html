<h1>COMP4403/COMP7402 - Compilers and Interpreters<br>Assignment 3</h1>
<h2>Due date: 15:00 Tuesday 25 May 2021 </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
This is an individual assignment which involves
modifying the assignment 3 compiler for the language PL0 to add 
named value and reference parameters, with defaults.
I'd suggest adding value parameters first,
and then default parameter expressions,
and then add reference parameters.

</p><h1>Assignment Compiler files</h1>

All sources for the assignment PL0 compiler are available as a3.zip (below). 
Please be sure to use the version for this assignment and not the one used for the tutorials or another assignment. 
There are differences (like the lexical tokens you need for this assignment are only defined in this version).
Note that the symbol table Scope and SymEntry and Type implementations have been extended already
to provide support for procedure parameters.

<p>
Please pay attention to course Blackboard announcments, and ensure you
follow the course discussion board (https://edstem.org/) for any
updates and further information on the assignment.
</p><ul>
  <li>Do not use imports for external packages other than those in <span class="emphasis">java.util.*</span>.
    Note that IntelliJ may offer the option of importing an external package to resolve an issue;
    please avoid taking this option because it will often add an erroneous import that you will not need.
    Such imports lead to the compilation failing in the environment in which your compiler will be assessed
    because that environment may not include the external libraries.
    Please check you are not importing external libraries before submitted.
<!--
  <li>Many people for assignment 1 imported arbitrary external libraries (that weren't actually used).
   Such imports led to the compilation failing in my test environment that does not include those libraries.
   Please check you aren't importing external libraries before submitted.
   <b>The only external imports allowed are from java.util.*</b>
-->
  </li><li>You must <b>only</b> modify the files that must be submitted (see below).
  </li><li>You must <b>not</b> modify any other files because we will be testing your implementation
    using the existing other files with your submitted files.
  </li><li>Please do <b>not</b> reformat the files because we would like to just print the differences
    between the originals and the versions you hand in.
  </li><li>Please keep the length of lines in your files below <b>100</b> characters, so that we can print them sensibly.
  </li><li>Please avoid using <b>non-standard</b> characters, e.g. Chinese characters, including in the comments.
    Non-standard characters are not accepted by some Java compilers and
    all comments should be readable by the person assessing your assignment.
  </li><li>Your implementation should be in Java <b>1.8</b>.
    Set the IntelliJ preferences for the Java compiler to 1.8 (or use the "-source 1.8" option to the Java compiler).
  </li><li>Please remove any debugging output before your assignment is submitted
    because debugging output will cause your program to fail our automated testing of your assignment.
  </li><li>Either avoid using tabs or set your tabs stops to 4 spaces (this is the default for IntelliJ)
    so that your files will print sensibly.
</li></ul>
Read the fine print in detail before you start!
And, most important, when you have finished implementing the assignment,
come back and reread the fine print again.

<h1>Procedures with value and reference parameters</h1>
<p>
The declaration of a procedure includes a list of formal parameters.
The type of each formal parameter is declared
and it optionally has a default expression to be used when the parameter is not supplied in the call.
Formal reference parameters are preceded by the keyword "var".
For example,
</p><pre>  // A procedure fact with
  // a formal value parameter n of type int with a default value of 0 and
  // a formal reference parameter r of type int with no default
  procedure fact( n: int &lt;- 0, var r: int ) =
   begin
    if n = 0 then
      r := 1
    else
     begin
      // The formal parameter n for the recursive call gets the value of the
      // local n minus 1, where the n within n-1 is the value of the formal
      // parameter n for this (calling) instance of fact.
      // The parameter r of the call is the formal parameter r of this
      // (calling) instance of fact.
      call fact( n &lt;- n-1, r &lt;- r);
      r := n * r
     end
   end // fact
</pre>
The above procedure returns the value of factorial n via r,
e.g., the call
<pre>    call fact( r&lt;-f, n&lt;-4 )
</pre>
assigns f the value of factorial 4, i.e., 4*3*2*1 = 24.
Note that as the parameters must be explicitly named in the call,
they can be in any order.
The following uses the default value for n, i.e. 0.
<pre>    call fact( r&lt;-f )
</pre>
It assigns f the value of factorial 0, i.e. 1.


<h1>Syntax Changes</h1>

<p>
The following lexical tokens have been added to the scanner module of PL0 already.
</p><ul>
  <table>
    <tbody><tr><td>COMMA</td>    <td>&#8594;</td>  <td>","</td></tr>
    <tr><td>GETS</td>     <td>&#8594;</td>  <td>"&lt;-"</td></tr>
  </tbody></table>
</ul>
<!--
Keywords are case sensitive.
<p>
-->
A procedure may have any number of formal value and reference parameters (zero or more).
Each formal parameter has a type and an optional default expression.
The syntax for a procedure declaration follows.
It is given in Extended BNF, 
but you won't be able to use the EBNF directly 
in the parser generator <b>Java-CUP</b> (see below).
<ul>
  ProcedureDef &#8594; ProcedureHead '=' Block ';'<br>
  ProcedureHead &#8594; 'procedure' IDENTIFIER '(' [ FormalParams  ] ')'<br>
  FormalParams &#8594; FormalParam { ',' FormalParam }<br>
  FormalParam &#8594; IDENTIFIER ':' TypeIdentifier [ '&lt;-' Condition ]<br>
  FormalParam &#8594; 'var' IDENTIFIER ':' TypeIdentifier [ '&lt;-' LValue ]
</ul>
A procedure call has a list of actual parameters,
each of which assigns an expression
(Condition really (to allow for boolean expressions))
to a formal parameter.
<ul>
  Statement &#8594; 'call' IDENTIFIER '(' [ ActualParams  ] ')'<br>
  ActualParams &#8594; ActualParam { ',' ActualParam }<br>
  ActualParam &#8594; IDENTIFIER '&lt;-' Condition
</ul>
Note that all actual parameter expressions are Conditions
in order to allow for boolean value parameters.
Type checking in the static checker is used to determine whether
the parameter expression is valid, in particular for a reference parameter.
<p>
You are expected to provide some syntax error recovery using Java CUP's
"error" symbol, in particular for formal and actual parameters.
Note that you must handle semantic errors appropriately,
including handling the situation when there is a syntax error,
i.e., your compiler should not crash because of a syntax error.
Your handling of syntax errors does not have to exactly match
that used for the sample solutions.


</p><h2>The Parser Generator Java-CUP</h2>

The parser specification for the compiler is specified in the file
<i>PL0.cup</i>.
You will need to add productions (and their associated actions) to the
specification and then run the parser generator <i>Java-CUP</i>
(using run configuration "Run CUP")
to generate the files <i>CUPParser.java</i> and <i>CUPToken.java</i>.
Do not modify these two Java files directly 
(even if you think you understand them (do you really?)) -
remake them from <i>PL0.cup</i>.
You should make the compiler before you change anything just to see
what forms of messages to expect. 
When you make the compiler (before you modify it) 
there will be some warning messages about the terminal symbols like
ILLEGAL
being declared but never used;
these are to be expected at this stage.
Any new warning/error messages will be significant.
There is HTML documentation for <i>Java-CUP</i> available from the
class web page (with the assignment).


<h2>The Scanner Generator JFlex</h2>

All the lexical tokens for this version of the compiler have already been
added to the lexical analyser. 
The file <i>Lexer.java</i> is automatically generated by the scanner
generator <i>JFlex</i> from <i>PL0.flex</i>;
again, do not modify <i>Lexer.java</i>  -
remake <i>Lexer.java</i> from <i>PL0.flex</i>.
<p>
Both <i>Java-CUP</i> and <i>JFlex</i> are available with the
assignment files on the course web page,
with instructions on how to run them in IntelliJ.
Java archives for <i>Java-CUP</i> and <i>JFlex</i> are part of the
IntelliJ project for the assignment.


</p><h1>Static Semantic Restrictions</h1>

First some terminology.
Note that there are three different scopes to consider.
<ul>
  <li><i>formal parameter:</i> the declared parameter in the procedure header
  </li><li><i>actual parameter:</i> the parameter in the call
  </li><li><i>declaration scope:</i> the (outer) scope in which the procedure is declared
  </li><li><i>local scope:</i> the (inner) scope containing the formal parameters
  and local variables of a procedure
  </li><li><i>calling scope:</i> the scope in which the procedure call occurs
</li></ul>
The name of a procedure must be distinct from all constants, variables,
types, and other procedures declared in the declaration scope (as already).
<p>
The names of all the formal parameters of a procedure must be distinct.
For the formal parameter declarations,
the formal parameters are treated as local to the procedure,
but the type identifiers and default expressions used in the parameter declarations are 
treated as being from the declaration scope of the procedure
(because the type and expression need to be shared with the calling context).
To achieve this the type identifiers and expressions in the formal parameter
declarations should be interpreted in the (outer) declaration scope of the procedure
but the formal parameters should be defined within the (inner) local scope.
</p><p>
A formal parameter name <b>x</b>, may be the same as the name
of a variable (or constant or type or procedure) declared non-locally;
within the procedure, <b>x</b> refers to the formal parameter
and any non-local <b>x</b> (a variable or other construct) is no longer accessible.
Names declared locally within the body of a procedure <i>p</i> 
cannot have the same name as a formal parameter of <i>p</i>
(unless they are within the local scope of a procedure nested within <i>p</i>),
i.e., formal parameters are in the same scope as local variables of the procedure.
</p><p>
For a procedure call on <i>p</i>,
the value of each formal parameter may be specified at most once
using an actual parameter of the form <tt>id &lt;- exp</tt>,
where <tt>id</tt> is the name of a formal parameter of <i>p</i> and
<tt>exp</tt> is an expression.
If <tt>id</tt> is a formal value parameter of type <i>T</i>,
<tt>exp</tt> must be assignment compatible with <i>T</i>.  
If <tt>id</tt> is a formal reference parameter of type <i>T</i>,
<tt>exp</tt> must be of type <i>ref(T)</i>.
If a formal parameter to <i>p</i> does not have a corresponding actual parameter in the call,
the default expression for the formal parameter is used;
if there is neither an actual parameter nor a default expression for the parameter, that is an error.
The default expression is defined in the declaration scope of the procedure
and must satisfy the same typing rules as an actual parameter.


</p><h1>Dynamic Semantics</h1>

For a procedure call,
it is as if fresh local variables corresponding to all the formal
<b>value</b> parameters are allocated.
All the value parameters are given the values of the corresponding
actual parameter expressions (or default expressions if there is no actual parameter)
and the statements in the body of the called procedure are executed.
The actual parameter expressions are evaluated once at call time.
The actual parameter expressions are evaluated with respect to the calling scope.
<p>
During execution of the body of a procedure any references to
a formal value parameter treat it as a local variable of the procedure,
and
any access (read or write) to a formal reference parameter will (indirectly) access
the corresponding actual parameter for that call each time.


</p><h2> Object Code</h2>

The PL0 compiler generates code for the Stack Machine.
A description of the stack machine is available in
<a href="https://learn.uq.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-6585336-dt-content-rid-36091159_1/courses/COMP4403S_7120_21405/publicweb/notes/Inst.pdf">Inst.pdf</a>.
See also the file <i>StackMachine.java</i> (near the end)
for details of the instruction set.

<p>
The Stack Machine provides features to help implement procedure calls.
</p><ul>
<li>The CALL instruction assumes that the top of the stack contains
  the address of the procedure to be called and the second top of
  stack been set up with the static link for the call. 
  It pops and remembers the address of the procedure
  (but leaves the static link on the stack where it is -- it becomes
  the first word of the new stack frame).
  It then pushes the frame pointer onto the stack to form the dynamic link, 
  and sets the frame pointer to the address of the (already set up) static link.
  Finally it pushes the return address (location of the instruction
  after the call) onto the stack and branches to the (saved) address
  of the procedure.
</li>
<li>The RETURN instruction exits from a procedure. 
  It automatically deallocates all the local variables (not parameters),
  pops the return address into the program instruction counter (pc),
  restores the frame pointer (fp) from the dynamic link,
  removes the dynamic and static links,
  and branches to the return address. 
</li>
<li>The ALLOC_STACK instruction is used to allocate locations on
  the run-time stack. It pops an argument from the top of
  the stack which is the number of words to allocate for local
  variables on the stack (not parameters).
</li>
<li>The DEALLOC_STACK instruction is used to deallocate words from
  the run-time stack. It pops an argument from the top of
  the stack which is the number of words to
  deallocate from the stack (used for parameters). 
</li>
</ul>
The usual way to implement parameters in a procedure call is 
that the values of the actual parameter expressions are 
loaded onto the stack before the call is made. 
Because all the parameters are placed on the stack prior to 
the stack frame being set up for the procedure,
all of the parameters are at negative offsets from the
frame pointer for the called procedure.
<p>
It is suggested that you implement a procedure call as follows.
Your generated code should:
</p><ul>
  <li>For each parameter 
      (in reverse order of their declaration),
      load the value of the corresponding actual parameter expression
      onto the stack.
      </li>
  <li>Note that these parameters
    on the stack can be directly accessed from within the procedure
    by using negative offsets from the frame pointer.
    If you load the first parameter on to the stack last, it will
    end up having the least (negative) offset from the frame
    pointer (e.g., -1 for an integer).
      </li>
  <li>For reference parameters the actual parameter should evaluate to
      an absolute address.
  </li><li>Set up the static link -- this is already done in the current
	code for parameterless procedures.</li>
  <li>Call the procedure (genCall may be of use
	for both the previous step and this step).</li>
  <li>Within the procedure, references to the formal parameters may be
	accomplished by using negative offsets from the current frame pointer. 
  </li><li>Within the procedure, formal value parameters look just like local
	variables (hint, hint) - the only difference is that their
	addresses have negative offsets).</li>
  <li>Within the procedure, formal reference parameters are absolute addresses
      of the actual parameters and need to be loaded and stored indirectly.</li>
  <li>After procedure exit, deallocate the space used by the
    actual parameters by using the DEALLOC_STACK instruction, 
    which expects a value on top of the stack indicating how many
    top of stack locations to discard, 
    i.e., the size of all the actual parameters.</li>
</ul>
<!--
A run time error can be indicated by calling the instruction <i>STOP</i>
with the appropriate error code on top of the stack.
-->

<h1>Student Misconduct</h1>

Students are reminded of the University's policy on student
misconduct, including plagiarism.  See the course profile and the
School web page
<a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/itee-student-misconduct-including-plagiarism">
http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/itee-student-misconduct-including-plagiarism</a>
<p>
You are expected to protect your files so that they are not readable by other users.
</p><p>
Your assignment is expected to be your own individual work and must
not include code copied from other students, current or past.  You are
also reminded not to post your (partial) solutions to assignments to
any place accessible by others (before or after the assignment
deadline), including the course discussion board or emailing to other
students.  If you need that sort of help consult the lecturer and/or
tutor.  Note that course discussion board allows private posts to the
instructors.
</p><p>
This assignment compiler is provided solely for the purposes of doing
this assignment and your solutions must never be shared, especially
publicly, even after completion of the course.  Such publication would
be considered both student misconduct and a breach of copyright.


</p><h1>Late Submission</h1>

<p>See section 5.3 of the course profile for details.</p>

<p>
If there are documented medical or exceptional circumstances that will
affect your ability to complete the assignment by the due date, then
you can apply for an extension. Extensions to non-exam assignments
must be requested via <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/">my.UQ</a>. You
can find instructions on how to submit your
request <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-extension">online</a>.
</p>

<p>
If the assignment is submitted after the deadline, without an approved
extension, a late penalty will apply. The late penalty shall be 10% of
the maximum possible mark for the assessment item will be deducted per
calendar day (or part thereof), up to a maximum of seven (7)
days. After seven days, no marks will be awarded for the item. A day
is considered to be a 24 hour block from the assessment item due
time. Negative marks will not be awarded.
</p>

<h1>Submission</h1>
<p>
Please keep the length of lines in your files below 100 characters,
so that we can print them sensibly.
You should avoid using tabs or set your tabs stops to 4 spaces so that
when we print them 
(with tab stops set to 4 spaces) 
they will print sensibly.
Don't forget to remove any code generating debugging output
and rogue external imports before submission.
</p><p>
You must submit your completed assignment electronically through 
the assessment section of 
the course <a href="https://learn.uq.edu.au/">BlackBoard site</a>
(the BlackBoard Assessment page rather than the course web pages).
</p><p>
You need to submit the following list of individual files
(not a .zip or other archive file)
for evaluation and marking.
Note that file names are case-sensitive.
You must only modify the files 
</p><ul>
  <li>PL0.cup</li>
  <li>ExpNode.java</li>
  <li>ExpTransform.java</li>
  <li>StatementNode.java</li>
  <li>StatementTransform.java</li>
  <li>StatementVisitor.java</li>
  <li>StaticChecker.java</li>
  <li>CodeGenerator.java</li>
</ul>
You can submit your assignment multiple times,
but only the last copy submitted will be retained for marking.


<h1>Assessment</h1>
<p>
The assignment is marked out of a total of 20 marks,
with marks will be allocated as follows:
</p><p>
   6 Syntax analysis and tree building
</p><p>
   8 Static semantics checking
</p><p>
   6 Code generation
</p><p>
Marks will be awarded for the correctness of the changes to each category.
<!--Readability, programming style and modular structure will also be criteria.-->
Readability and modular structure will also be criteria.
For readability, we expect that you follow good software engineering practice,
such as appropriate choices of variable names,
consistent indentation, appropriate comments where needed, etc.
For modularity we expect you introduce new methods where it makes sense to help structure the program
and to avoid unnecessary duplication of code.
Use of generic Java utility interfaces (like Set, Map, List, Queue, ...) and
their implementations (like HashSet, ..., TreeMap, ..., LinkedList, ...)
is encouraged.
We expect you to produce well structured programs that are not unnecessarily complex,
both structurally
(e.g. complex control flow that is hard to follow),
and in terms of execution time and space requirements,
(e.g. an O(n) algorithm is preferred to an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm,
and a O(log n) algorithm is even better).

</p><p>
Your assignment files will be compiled in the context of the remaining
assignment files and put through a sequence of tests.
The total mark for this assignment will be limited by the
overall success of the development in the following way:
</p><ul>
   <li>The program submitted does not compile: Maximum 10/20.</li>
   <li>The program submitted will not correctly handle any test case with 
       the new facilities: Maximum 13/20.</li>
</ul>
You are not required to correct any bugs that may exist in the original compiler.
However, we would appreciate being informed of any such bugs
that you detect, so that we can correct them,
or any improvements to the compiler you might like to suggest.
