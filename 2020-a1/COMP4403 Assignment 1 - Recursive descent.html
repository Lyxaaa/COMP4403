<h1>COMP4403 - Compilers and Interpreters<br>Assignment 1</h1>
<h2>Due date: 15:00 Monday 12th April, 2021</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<p> This is an individual assignment which involves modifying the
recursive descent compiler for the language PL0 to add a <b>skip</b>
statement, a multiple assignment statement, and a case (switch)
statement.

</p><h2>Assignment Compiler files</h2>

All sources for the assignment PL0 compiler are available as a1.zip (below). 
Please be sure to use the version for this assignment and not the one used for the tutorials or another assignment. 
There are differences (like the lexical tokens you need for this assignment are only defined in this version).
<ul>

<p>
Please pay attention to course Blackboard announcments, and ensure you
follow the course discussion board (https://edstem.org/) for any
updates and further information on the assignment.
</p><ul>
  <li>Do not use imports for external packages other than those in <span class="emphasis">java.util.*</span>.
    Note that IntelliJ may offer the option of importing an external package to resolve an issue;
    please avoid taking this option because it will often add an erroneous import that you will not need.
    Such imports lead to the compilation failing in the environment in which your compiler will be assessed
    because that environment may not include the external libraries.
    Please check you are not importing external libraries before submitted.
  </li><li>You must <b>only</b> modify the files that must be submitted (see below).
  </li><li>You must <b>not</b> modify any other files because we will be testing your implementation
    using the existing other files with your submitted files.
  </li><li>Please do <b>not</b> reformat the files because we would like to just print the differences
    between the originals and the versions you hand in.
  </li><li>Please keep the length of lines in your files below <b>100</b> characters, so that we can print them sensibly.
  </li><li>Please avoid using <b>non-standard</b> characters, e.g. Chinese characters, including in the comments.
    Non-standard characters are not accepted by some Java compilers and
    all comments should be readable by the person assessing your assignment.
  </li><li>Your implementation should be in Java <b>1.8</b>.
    Set the IntelliJ preferences for the Java compiler to 1.8 (or use the "-source 1.8" option to the Java compiler).
  </li><li>Please remove any debugging output before your assignment is submitted
    because debugging output will cause your program to fail our automated testing of your assignment.
  </li><li>Either avoid using tabs or set your tabs stops to 4 spaces (this is the default for IntelliJ)
    so that your files will print sensibly.
</li></ul>
Read the fine print in detail before you start!
And, most important, when you have finished implementing the assignment,
come back and reread the fine print again.


<h3>Overview</h3>

The multiple assignment statement allows a list of variables to be simultaneously assigned the values of
a list of expressions.
The trick is that all the expressions are evaluated before any of the assignments takes place,
for example, the following multiple assignment <b>swaps</b> the values of x and y:
<pre>   x := y | y := x
</pre>
The following assignment rotates the values of x, y and z:
<pre>   x := y | y := z | z := x
</pre>
<p>
The following <b>case</b> statement assigns to y exactly once.
</p><pre>  case i of 
  when 2: y := 1 
  when 3: y := x 
  when 5: y := x*x 
  default y := 42
  end
</pre>



<h3>Syntax Changes</h3>

The following lexical tokens have been added to the scanner module of PL0 already.
<ul>
        <table>
                <tbody><tr><td>BAR</td>        <td>&#8594;</td>  <td>"|"</td></tr>
                <tr><td>KW_CASE</td>    <td>&#8594;</td>  <td>"case"</td></tr>
                <tr><td>KW_OF</td>      <td>&#8594;</td>  <td>"of"</td></tr>
                <tr><td>KW_WHEN</td>    <td>&#8594;</td>  <td>"when"</td></tr>
                <tr><td>KW_DEFAULT</td> <td>&#8594;</td>  <td>"default"</td></tr>
                <tr><td>KW_SKIP</td>    <td>&#8594;</td>  <td>"skip"</td></tr>
        </tbody></table>
</ul>
Keywords are case sensitive.
<p>
The non-terminal <i>Statement</i> in the grammar for PL0 is modified to
the following Extended Backus-Naur Form (EBNF) grammar rules.
</p><ul>
  <table>
        <tbody><tr><td>Statement</td>  <td>&#8594;</td>  <td>WhileStatement | IfStatement | CallStatement |</td></tr>
        <tr><td></td>           <td></td>       <td>Assignment | ReadStatement | WriteStatement | CompoundStatement |</td></tr>
        <tr><td></td>           <td></td>       <td><font color="blue">SkipStatement | CaseStatement</font>  </td></tr>
  </tbody></table>
</ul>
<p>
where
</p><ul>
  <table>
    <tbody><tr><td>SkipStatement</td>  <td>&#8594;</td><td>KW_SKIP</td></tr>
        <tr><td>Assignment</td>    <td>&#8594;</td><td>SingleAssign { BAR SingleAssign }</td></tr>
        <tr><td>SingleAssign</td>    <td>&#8594;</td><td>LValue ASSIGN Condition
        </td></tr><tr><td>CaseStatement</td>  <td>&#8594;</td><td>KW_CASE Condition KW_OF { CaseBranch } [ KW_DEFAULT StatementList ] KW_END</td></tr>
        <tr><td>CaseBranch</td>     <td>&#8594;</td><td>KW_WHEN Constant COLON StatementList</td></tr>
  </tbody></table>
</ul>
Note that
each branch of a <b>case</b> statement contains a statement list, rather than just a single statement,
and that
the labels on each branch are constant expressions
(defined using the existing nonterminal <i>Constant</i>)
and hence their values can be determined at compile time 
(static analysis time to be more precise).
<p>
The addition of a <b>skip</b> statement allows one to write
</p><pre>    if x &lt; 0 then x := -x else skip
</pre>
to assign x its absolute value.
Equivalently one can use the following:
<pre>    case x &lt; 0 of
    when true: x := -x
    when false: skip
    end
</pre>



<h3>Static Semantic Restrictions</h3>

<h4>Skip statement</h4>

There aren't any static semantic restrictions on the <b>skip</b> statement,
that is, it is well formed for any symbol table context.
<center>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp; &#8866; &nbsp;&nbsp;  WFStatement(<b>skip</b>)
</center>

<h4>Multiple assignment</h4>

All of the variables on the left sides of a multiple assignment must be distinct.
The type of each condition (expression) must be assignment compatible (coercible) to 
the type of the corresponding variable to which it is assigned.
<center>
  &#8704; i, j &#8712; [1..n] &nbsp; • &nbsp; i &#8800; j  &#8658; v<sub>i</sub> &#8800; v<sub>j</sub><br>
  &#8704; i &#8712; [1..n] &nbsp; • &nbsp;  (syms &nbsp; &#8866; &nbsp; v<sub>i</sub> : ref(T<sub>i</sub>)) &amp;&amp; (syms &nbsp; &#8866; &nbsp; e<sub>i</sub> : T<sub>i</sub>)<br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms  &#8866;   WFStatement(v<sub>1</sub> :=  e<sub>1</sub> | v<sub>2</sub> := e<sub>2</sub> |  ... | v<sub>n</sub> := e<sub>n</sub>)
</center>

<h4>Case statement</h4>
<p>
The type of the expression (condition) for the <b>case</b> statement
must be a scalar type
(it could be int or boolean or a subrange thereof)
and all labels of case branches must be compatible with that type
and must be elements of the type (see containsElement in Type.java).
The labels must be constant expressions, and
the value of each label must be unique within a single <b>case</b> statement.
The bodies of all the case branches must be well formed.
</p><p>
The rule for well formedness of a <b>case</b> statement is given below;
within it T must be a scalar type and for a scalar type values(T) is
the set of values in the type T,
e.g. values(boolean) = {false,true} and values([-2..2]) = {-2,-1,0,1,2}.
</p><center>
  syms &nbsp; &#8866; &nbsp; e : T <br>
  isScalarType(T)<br>
  syms &nbsp; &#8866; &nbsp; WFStatement(ss)<br>
  &#8704; j &#8712; [1..n] &nbsp; • &nbsp;&nbsp;
     syms&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  WFStatement(ss<sub>j</sub>) &nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&amp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
     syms&nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  c<sub>j</sub> : T &nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&amp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        (c<sub>j</sub> &#8594;<sup>e</sup> v<sub>j</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp; &#8658; &nbsp;&nbsp;
            v<sub>j</sub> &#8712; values(T))<br>
     &#8704; i,j &#8712; [1..n] &nbsp; • &nbsp;
        i &#8800; j  &nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&amp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        c<sub>i</sub> &#8594;<sup>e</sup> v<sub>i</sub> &nbsp;&nbsp; &amp;&amp; &nbsp;&nbsp;
        c<sub>j</sub> &#8594;<sup>e</sup> v<sub>j</sub>  &nbsp;&nbsp; &#8658; &nbsp;&nbsp;
            v<sub>i</sub> &#8800; v<sub>j</sub><br>
  <span style="text-decoration: underline;">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><br>
  syms &nbsp;&nbsp;&#8866;&nbsp;&nbsp;  WFStatement(case e of when c<sub>1</sub>: ss<sub>1</sub> when c<sub>2</sub>: ss<sub>2</sub>
  ... when c<sub>n</sub>: ss<sub>n</sub> default ss end)
</center>
When determining the scalar type T to be used in the rule,
it is assumed that we do not make use of widening or narrowing rules for the types of expressions
but we may need to dereference a reference type (to get a scalar type).
<p>
For the version of the case statement in which there is no default clause,
the requirement for the well-formedness of its statement sequence ss is omitted.


</p><h3>Dynamic Semantics</h3>

<h4>Skip statement</h4>

The <b>skip</b> statement does nothing. The less it does the better.

<h4>Multiple assignment</h4>

For a multiple assignment, all the expressions in all the assignments are evaluated
before any of the variables are assigned,
and then all of the assignments take place.
Note that it doesn't matter in what order the simple assignments are done
because the left sides are all distinct and the expressions have all
been evaluated using the values of the variables before any
assignments take place 
(and the language does not have any side effects).


<h4>Case statement</h4>
<p>
  The <b>case</b> statement evaluates its (scalar) expression to a
  value, v, and then selects the branch with the label that has value
  v and executes the corresponding statement.  If the value of the
  expression is not equal to any of the labels of any of the branches
  then the <b>default</b> branch is executed.  If there is
  no <b>default</b> branch, this is considered a <b>runtime error</b>
  and the interpreter is terminated by a call to method <b>runtime</b>
  with an error message "expression in case doesn't match any label".
</p><p>
On completion of the execution of the appropriate branch within a <b>case</b> statement,
the next statement executed is the one following the whole <b>case</b> statement.
That is, it is <b>NOT</b> like a switch statement in which execution
of one branch flows into the next branch unless a <b>break</b> statement
is placed at the end of the first branch -- a language feature that is the
source of many a bug.


</p><h3>Interpreter</h3>

The PL0 compiler for this assignment uses an interpreter (rather than generate code).
A description of the interpreter is available in
<a href="https://learn.uq.edu.au/bbcswebdav/pid-6373330-dt-content-rid-34642083_1/courses/COMP4403S_7120_21405/publicweb/notes/Interpreter.pdf">Interpreter.pdf</a>.
<p>
The interpretation is done in class <i>Interpreter</i>,
which uses class <i>Frame</i> for its runtime stack and
class <i>Value</i> for the runtime representation of values.
Each kind of expression/statement node in the PL0 abstract syntax tree
has a "visit" method that interprets (evaluates/executes) the corresponding expression/statement.
</p><p>
The interpreter for the <b>skip</b> statement is trivial.
</p><p>
The interpreter for the multiple assignment has to be careful to evaluate all expressions before doing any assignments.
</p><p>
The interpreter for the <b>case</b> statement is quite simple (a handful of lines)
provided you have chosen a suitable representation for the CaseStatementNode.

</p><h3>Tests</h3>

Some tests are available in the <b>test-pgm</b> directory (in a1.zip),
and can be used to help you to debug your code. All of the tests can
be run together using the <b>Test PL0</b> configuration. You can also
individually run a test using <b>Run PL0</b> on a selected PL0
program. The test cases of the form
<b>test-base*.pl0</b> are useful for regression testing, to make sure
that you haven't broken any existing functionality in the compiler, and
the other tests can help you find bugs in the new compiler
features.

<h3>Student Misconduct</h3>

Students are reminded of the University's policy on student
misconduct, including plagiarism.  See the course profile and the
School web page
<a href="http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/itee-student-misconduct-including-plagiarism">
http://www.itee.uq.edu.au/itee-student-misconduct-including-plagiarism</a>
<p>
You are expected to protect your files so that they are not readable by other users.
</p><p>
Your assignment is expected to be your own individual work and must
not include code copied from other students, current or past.  You are
also reminded not to post your (partial) solutions to assignments to
any place accessible by others (before or after the assignment
deadline), including the course discussion board or emailing to other
students.  If you need that sort of help consult the lecturer and/or
tutor.  Note that course discussion board allows private posts to the
instructors.
</p><p>
This assignment compiler is provided solely for the purposes of doing
this assignment and your solutions must never be shared, especially
publicly, even after completion of the course.  Such publication would
be considered both student misconduct and a breach of copyright.

</p><h3>Late Submission</h3>

<p>See section 5.3 of the course profile for details.</p>

<p>
If there are documented medical or exceptional circumstances that will
affect your ability to complete the assignment by the due date, then
you can apply for an extension. Extensions to non-exam assignments
must be requested via <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/">my.UQ</a>. You
can find instructions on how to submit your
request <a href="https://my.uq.edu.au/information-and-services/manage-my-program/exams-and-assessment/applying-extension">online</a>.
</p>

<p>
If the assignment is submitted after the deadline, without an approved
extension, a late penalty will apply. The late penalty shall be 10% of
the maximum possible mark for the assessment item will be deducted per
calendar day (or part thereof), up to a maximum of seven (7)
days. After seven days, no marks will be awarded for the item. A day
is considered to be a 24 hour block from the assessment item due
time. Negative marks will not be awarded.
</p>

<!--
A penalty of 5% of the maximum mark for an assignment will be deducted for each day or part thereof late up to a limit of 7 days,
after which time assignments will not be accepted for assessment unless you have been granted an extension.
<p>
As we plan to hand back assignments a week or two after submission,
requests for extension will not be accepted more than one week late,
unless there are exceptional circumstances. 
<p>
Requests for extensions should be accompanied by suitable documentation 
(see the course profile for details).
<p>
Personal hardware or computer failures are not grounds for extension.
Assignments must be backed up on the university system.
-->

<h3>Submission</h3>
Please keep the length of lines in your files below 100 characters,
so that we can print them sensibly.
You should avoid using tabs or set your tabs stops to 4 spaces so that
when we print them 
(with tab stops set to 4 spaces) 
they will print sensibly.
Do not forget to remove any code generating debugging output
and any rogue external imports before submission.
<p>
You must submit your completed assignment electronically through 
the assessment section of 
the course <a href="https://learn.uq.edu.au/">BlackBoard site</a>
(the BlackBoard Assessment page rather than the course web pages).
</p><p>
You need to submit the following list of individual files
(not a .zip or any other form of archive file)
for evaluation and marking.
Note that file names are case-sensitive.
You must only modify the files 
</p><ul>
  <li>Interpreter.java</li>
  <li>Parser.java</li>
  <li>StatementNode.java</li>
  <li>StatementVisitor.java</li>
  <li>StaticChecker.java</li>
</ul>
You can submit your assignment multiple times,
but only the last copy submitted will be retained for marking.

<h3>Assessment</h3>


The assignment is marked out of a total of 20 marks.
Marks will be allocated as follows:
<ul>
   <li>8 - Syntax analysis including syntax error recovery and tree building</li>
   <li>7 - Static semantics checking</li>
   <li>5 - Interpreter</li>
</ul>
Marks will be awarded for the correctness of the changes to each category.
<p>
Readability, modular structure, and structural and computational complexity are also criteria.
For readability, we expect that you follow good software engineering practice,
such as appropriate choices of variable names,
consistent indentation, appropriate comments where needed, etc.
For modularity we expect you introduce new methods where it makes sense to help structure the program
and especially to avoid unnecessary duplication of code.
Use of generic Java utility interfaces (like Set, Map, List, Queue, ...) and
their implementations (like HashSet, ..., TreeMap, ..., LinkedList, ...)
is encouraged.
We expect you to produce well structured programs that are not unnecessarily complex,
both structurally
(e.g. complex control flow that is hard to follow),
and in terms of execution time and space requirements,
(e.g. an O(n) algorithm is preferred to an O(n<sup>2</sup>) algorithm,
and a O(log n) algorithm is even better).
</p><p>
Your assignment files will be compiled in the context of the remaining
assignment files and put through a sequence of tests.
The total mark for this assignment will be limited by the
overall success of the development in the following way:
</p><ul>
   <li>The program submitted does not compile: Maximum 10/20.</li>
   <li>The program submitted will not correctly handle any test case with 
       the new facilities: Maximum 13/20.</li>
</ul>
You are not required to correct any bugs that may exist in the original compiler.
However, we would appreciate being informed of any such bugs that you detect,
so that we can correct them,
or any improvements to the compiler you might like to suggest.
